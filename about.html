        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
I am Rishabh Singh, a Software Engineer with a B.Tech in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence from IIIT Dharwad. With a strong foundation in Python, JavaScript, and C++, I have developed expertise in machine learning, data analysis, and web development. I have hands-on experience working with industry-standard tools like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Power BI, and I have applied my skills in real-world projects such as sarcasm detection and housing price prediction.<br><hr>

I have completed job simulations with leading firms like BCG and Accenture, where I delivered high-impact solutions for customer churn prediction, financial chatbot development, and data analytics for social media trends. My web development experience includes an internship at CodSoft, where I enhanced my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills while collaborating with a dynamic team.<br><hr>

I am passionate about solving complex problems, continuously learning, and leveraging technology to drive meaningful results. In addition to my technical skills, I am an active blogger, sharing insights on technology and personal development, and a dedicated athlete with multiple accolades in javelin throw. I am now seeking a challenging role in data science or software engineering where I can contribute my skills and grow professionally.
